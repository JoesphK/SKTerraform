# Terraform infrastructure deployer
## Overview
This project aims to deploy cloud infrastructure using code using modular blocks.

## Features

- **Modular architecture** â€” infrastructure divided into reusable modules  
- Clear separation of **variables**, **outputs**, and **main block**  
- Easy to add new modules or resources  
- Backend state management

- Open it in visual studio
- Adjust the components you need to add/ remove in the root main.tf
- Initilize terraform using: terraform init
- Add your credentials to AWS using aws configure (You will need to install aws library in your IDE of choice/ powershell)
- Specify the bucket name that will be used to apply the lock under backend.tf
- Run terraform plan to check your infrastructure
- If successful run terraform apply -auto-approve
## Future work
- Add the creation of EKS clusters
- Add the creation of load balancers
- Add the creation of dynamoDB
